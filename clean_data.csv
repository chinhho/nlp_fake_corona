therapy protecting treating coronavirus infection ignored actual evidence people experience rest world currently experiencing namely wuhan china specifically doctor front line china worst epidemic singing praise vitamin c infusion today objective health take look one old favorite multiple condition including coronavirus infection mighty vitamin c taking vitamin c actually something everyone could make difference state immune system well beyond wash hand elliot hello everyone welcome week edition objective health host elliot joining studio doug erica also damian one two today elliot today going talking hot topic going talking coronavirus couple week ago maybe couple month ago another show coronavirus assessing whether thought really dangerous whether little bit kicking frenzy going medium little bit overblown today show going looking potential solution people think hopefully make use talk clinical utility using high dose vitamin c coronavirus quite lot interesting information come recently top well established information know vitamin c potential us virus coronavirus virus good reason think come virus immunocompromised little bit susceptible succumbing kind viral infection using vitamin c high dos various different method consumption likely going helpful first want talk one recent progression come china long ago china announced would thinking using intravenous vitamin c coronavirus patient three study done china believe looking effect vitamin c coronavirus come pretty good result one chinese medical establishment scientist advocating use anywhere mg mg vitamin c used intravenously think severe patient viral infection doug interesting thing dos talking mg vitamin c iv even really high know thing like cancer protocol get high g even higher sometimes low dose mean could take mg orally fact getting good result dos say lot power vitamin c think erica definitely mainstream news least u pooh poohing alternative thing think vitamin c going cure really concerning take something going keep immune system strong instead essentially dumping baby bathwater saying nothing going work people sort vitamin c medicine cabinet type thing good keep immune system strong doug really surprising nonetheless shocking way medium downplaying seen people reporting even mentioned china actually using vitamin c strategy coronavirus basically blanked like tulsi gabbard even mention fact despite fact many doctor china actually reporting talking explicitly saying help news medium turn around ignore fact even go far condemn right word like said erica pooh pooh essentially oh wait vaccine bother woo woo hippy crap meanwhile even people taking mg vitamin c time day would least helpful necessarily mean get going cure instantly anything help mitigate effect prevent stupid medium taking kind stance elliot saw article earlier today abc news think one alphabet news agency article titled coronavirus cure debunked talking vitamin c completely pooh poohing idea even like ignoring actively telling people take spineless thing well established one top alternative integrated doctor quoted saying early sufficiently large dos intravenous vitamin c critical vitamin c prototypical antioxidant also involved virus killing prevention viral replication significance large dose intravenous vitamin c antiviral level acute respiratory distress syndrome kill people coronavirus ards acute respiratory distress syndrome common final pathway leading death talking vitamin c one best way protect especially going apply people susceptible kind infection think fair say people get probably going major issue mortality rate people pre existing severe health condition immunocompromisation etc kind people wise take right precaution listening medium quick whip hysteria provide solution doug seems like almost point literally nothing except wash hand laugher thing keep saying wash hand wash hand reading somewhere someone talking disproportionate crazy hysteria pumping thing actually offering something wash hand disproportionate level threat like threat solution wash hand anything people actually could like take vitamin c saying going work wash hand actually article green med info called ton vitamin c wuhan maybe pull one damian scroll bit tweet dsm wanted show show truck delivering ton vitamin c wuhan date one guess cut date see article march rd clearly delivering ton hell lot vitamin c using pretty disingenuous western medium completely ignore fact outbreak italy anywhere else start get really bad could benefit information doctor could benefit could actually helping people hospital fighting home could benefit information make blood boil would pull kind shit terrible erica good article called vaccination virus vitamin c potent antidote orthomolecular medicine news service january talk china list addendum regarding practical treatment approach coronavirus china thing really stick strong immune system really significant protection individual keeping vitamin c going also said great deal immune system strength possibly come vitamin c content immune cell level vitamin c body low immune system never function full capacity many measure strengthen support immune system regular supplementation vitamin c multi gram dos mg daily probably single important preventative measure much larger dos given determined virus already contracted also talking nebulising hydrogen peroxide destroys sort virus body help vitamin c magnesium mop rest virus pretty helpful people freaking think anything something keep taking preventative measure anything doug professional doctor intravenous vitamin c probably stated even access intravenous vitamin c people actually still worthwhile taking orally well take much start feel digestive symptom real side effect except diarrhoea take much would rather deal coronavirus little bit upset tummy mention website http orthomolecular org article talking came actually really good site go orthomolecular org scroll say news release number thing specifically use vitamin c coronavirus talk used wuhan different chinese doctor reporting anybody interested information good resource erica something like liposomal know talked show making liposomal vitamin c survives digestive tract little bit better obviously intravenous get much liposomal encapsulated sphere survive digestive tract get body effectively doug basically increasing absorption nutrient take certain percentage get absorbed rest taking liposomal liposheric sometimes called increase amount getting across digestive tract bloodstream yeah effective elliot making really make effectively people claim make hold testing make proper liposomal need proper liposomal technology really want liposomal vitamin c better getting really high quality one paying money high quality vitamin c could probably get similar benefit taking small amount multiple time throughout day take high dose one given time absorb much one given time taking g every hour going continual absorption going opening transporter absorb make sense lot option get intravenous liposomal oral going route take term vitamin c actually many way look vitamin c well known immune booster primarily one level promoting immune cell function certain immune cell responsible engulfing pathogen identifying clearing infection quickly become depleted ascorbic acid immune cell responsible surveillance lot ascorbic acid within job lose quickly taking ascorbic acid essentially topping immune cell immune cell really like ascorbic acid look specifically coronavirus interesting article written lady called doris loh done lot writing vitamin c various property specifically relation vitamin c coronavirus looking mechanism actually infects cause problem human body virus trying trick immune system evolved way affect immune system go undetected unable kill context trick immune system trying surveil environment pick invader take lot energy virus disrupts immune system working affecting well cell able synthesise energy certain protein called n protein virus block mitochondrion stop synthesising atp idea vitamin c working way cell synthesising energy form atp using thing called electron carrier something called nadh fadh transported mitochondrion donating electron going another various set process make usable energy virus infects cell disrupts mitochondrion functioning longer actually become depleted nadh nadh unable effectively donate electron ascorbic acid take place nadh act electron donor synthesise energy almost like ascorbic acid act energy source cell context immune dysfunction usually function ascorbic acid usually used antioxidant damage occurs cell called oxidation cell lose electron function vitamin c donate electron called reduction essentially antioxidant used making energy whereas doris loh saying case mitochondrion screwed viral infection vitamin c longer becomes antioxidant actually donating electron u make energy well established fact might one reason high dos actually necessary actually providing sustained form energy cell cell infected virus unable make mean doug interesting elliot might one way vitamin c actually beneficial aside role one way coronavirus messing immune system activating something called cytokine storm innate immune system inflammatory process ramp completely someone susceptible necessarily turn virus kill per se immune system inability shut immune system vitamin c potentially allowing u effectively shut immune system need lot different way vitamin c might helping definitely antioxidant multiple different mechanism absolutely fascinating would recommend listener read called mitochondrion coronavirus vitamin c connection people really need know vitamin c really useful downplay effect antioxidant doug also used pro oxidant well heard pro oxidant capability well something immune system us eliminate virus bacteria thing like elliot exactly think one main mechanism cancer know happening virus familiar effect would make sense case take ascorbic acid low dos generally antioxidant giving ultra high dos actually generates hydrogen peroxide pro oxidant effect particularly cancer cell quite selective cancer cell know would work virus think work infection similar way think lot stuff know erica going back saying cytokine storm stress also effect reaction everyone fear stress people feeling sure folk feeling europe also u stress adding cytokine storm inflammation body creating worse environment body ruminating stressing instead trying calm system elliot really unfortunate seems like causing lot harm inherently destructive sheer amount frenzy hysteria going seems relatively disproportionate actual threat coronavirus compare statistic infectious outbreak seems relatively minor pretty much nothing burger opinion medium make worse boogeyman moment think people really scared understandably well informed well informed boost immune system kind stuff unfortunate ultimately really important know cortisol stress hormone also modulates immune system like saying erica multiple branch immune system stress hormone going suppressing branch immune system responsible surveilling infection virus parasite type immune cell responsible one talking natural killer cell lymphocyte different thing go around body constant lookout virus bacteria pathogen sensitive cortisol cortisol quickly downregulate system time upregulate system responsible attacking tissue autoimmune condition massively rise people tend get sick frequently well allowing get overly stressed definitely worst possible thing could want protect infection like difficult watching medium doug turn erica saying show u walk outside thing seem normal turn computer end world coming via coronavirus unknown elliot anything else anyone would like say doug one thing could say popular conception vitamin c high orange orange juice marketing want get actual vitamin c supplement amount find food unfortunately negligible talking therapeutic dos eating orange drinking orange really going cut wanted point want taking least gram time microgram damian milligram doug milligram thank damian microgram going cut either erica probably better cost effective buy ascorbic acid powder opposed chewable one flintstone make laughter know mean flintstone vitamin powder better cocktail got lord know kind filer point buy flintstone vitamin c elliot much cheaper get powder get g reason people often notice suffering kind infection tolerance go way usually someone take gram make get digestive symptom infection go least time tolerate time usually could tolerated know couple people managed go gram poorly previously could tolerate g definitely get used way sick need much every day suffering infection find tends help erica proactive prevent stress mechanism taking keep making little detox cocktail vitamin c water enjoyable taste lot worse thing doug true elliot ok today want thank everyone thanks

foundation funding cepi supporting development rna vaccine platform nearly decade planning use make vaccine disease affect poor like malaria looking like one promising option covid first candidate start human trial rna vaccine created company called moderna rna vaccine work rather injecting pathogen antigen body instead give body genetic code needed produce antigen antigen appear outside cell immune system attack learns defeat future intruder process essentially turn body vaccine manufacturing unit rna vaccine let body work require much material make much faster manufacture catch though know sure yet rna viable platform vaccine since covid would first rna vaccine gate prove platform work creates immunity bit like building computer system first piece software time even rna vaccine continues show promise still must continue pursuing option know yet covid vaccine look like go full steam ahead many approach possible might perfect vaccine yet okay smallpox vaccine vaccine wiped entire disease face earth also pretty brutal receive left scar arm anyone got one every three people side effect bad enough keep home school work small insignificant number developed serious reaction smallpox vaccine far perfect got job done covid vaccine might similar designing perfect vaccine want completely safe percent effective single dose give lifelong protection easy store transport hope covid vaccine quality given timeline may two priority mentioned earlier safety efficacy since might time multi year study conduct robust phase safety trial make sure good real world evidence vaccine completely safe use bit wiggle room efficacy suspect vaccine least percent effective enough stop outbreak percent effective vaccine useable might still see localized outbreak anything percent unlikely create enough herd immunity stop virus big challenge making sure vaccine work well older people older le effective vaccine immune system like rest body age slower recognize attack invader big issue covid vaccine since older people vulnerable need make sure protected shingle vaccine also targeted older people combat amping strength vaccine possible something similar covid although might come side effect health authority could also ask people certain age get additional dose beyond safety efficacy couple factor consider many dos vaccine get easier quicker deliver may need multi dose vaccine get enough efficacy long last ideally vaccine give long lasting protection might end one stop getting sick couple month like seasonal flu vaccine protects six month happens short term vaccine might used work durable one store many common vaccine kept degree c around temperature average refrigerator storage transportation easy rna vaccine need stored much colder temperature low degree c make reaching certain part world difficult hope vaccine month close perfect possible even continue working improve happens suspect covid vaccine become part routine newborn immunization schedule vaccine though still huge problem solve need manufacture distribute least billion dos vaccine order stop pandemic need make vaccine available almost every person planet never delivered something every corner world mentioned earlier vaccine particularly difficult make store lot figure manufacturing distributing vaccine know exactly working example able use existing vaccine factory make covid vaccine build different kind vaccine factory prepare vaccine type requires different kind factory need ready facility make type start manufacturing final vaccine vaccine soon cost billion dollar government need quickly find mechanism making funding available foundation currently working cepi government figure financing part discussion center get vaccine reality everyone able get vaccine time take month even year create billion dos possibly billion multi dose vaccine start distributing soon first batch ready go people agree health worker get vaccine first get next older people teacher worker essential job think low income country first receive people much higher risk dying place covid spread much quicker poor country measure like physical distancing harder enact people poor underlying health make vulnerable complication weak health system make harder receive care need getting vaccine low income country could save million life good news already organization expertise gavi vaccine alliance vaccine manufacturer sign deal country factory located country get first crack vaccine unclear happen hope find way get equitable basis whole world national health authority need develop distribution plan better understanding working eventually though going scale thing vaccine available everyone able get back normal hopefully make decision prevent u situation ever might bit hard see right light

general important relevant principle apply radio wave including cell phone g technology finally get make g unique also concerned topic came across alarming article tv segment danger g make sure actually russian propaganda designed hold back u technologically economically yes russian exactly terminology looking whether phone might pose kind health risk human take long run scary sounding term like radiation absorption safe power level also quickly run summary research seem leave lot wiggle room include alarming statement like possibly carcinogenic human order approach topic rationally

gradually flu according healthline older adult people underlying medical condition including heart disease lung disease diabetes appear higher risk serious complication covid compared people younger age group without underlying condition overall hospitalization rate covid u hospitalization per people may although hospitalization rate adult age older higher hospitalization per people according cdc however fewer people likely gotten covid u gotten flu odds becoming hospitalized confirmed case covid thought higher odds hospitalized influenza child high risk group complication flu seem case covid child hospitalized new coronavirus study covid case united state published march found among reported case least people hospitalized le younger year old recently covid linked rare serious inflammatory
