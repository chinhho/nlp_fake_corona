cell level vitamin body low immune system never function full capacity many measure strengthen support immune system regular supplementation vitamin multi gram dos mg daily probably single important preventative measure much larger dos given determined already contracted also talking nebulising hydrogen peroxide destroys sort virus body help vitamin magnesium mop rest pretty helpful freaking think anything something keep taking preventative measure anything doug professional doctor intravenous vitamin probably stated even access intravenous vitamin actually still worthwhile taking orally well take much start feel digestive symptom real side effect except diarrhoea take much would rather deal little bit upset tummy mention website http orthomolecular org article talking came actually really good site go orthomolecular org scroll say news release number thing specifically use vitamin talk used wuhan different chinese doctor reporting anybody interested information good resource erica something like liposomal know talked show making liposomal vitamin survives digestive tract little bit better obviously intravenous get much liposomal encapsulated sphere survive digestive tract get body effectively doug basically increasing absorption nutrient take certain percentage get absorbed rest taking liposomal liposheric sometimes called increase amount getting across digestive tract bloodstream yeah effective elliot making really make effectively claim make hold testing make proper liposomal need proper liposomal technology really want liposomal vitamin better getting really high quality one paying money high quality vitamin could probably get similar benefit taking small amount multiple time throughout day take high dose one given time absorb much one given time taking every hour going continual absorption going opening transporter absorb make sense lot option get intravenous liposomal oral going route take term vitamin actually many way look vitamin well known immune booster primarily one level promoting immune cell function certain immune cell responsible engulfing pathogen identifying clearing infection quickly become depleted ascorbic acid immune cell responsible surveillance lot ascorbic acid within job lose quickly taking ascorbic acid essentially topping immune cell immune cell really like ascorbic acid look specifically interesting article written lady called doris loh done lot writing vitamin various property specifically relation vitamin looking mechanism actually infects cause problem human body trying trick immune system evolved way affect immune system go undetected unable kill context trick immune system trying surveil environment pick invader take lot energy disrupts immune system working affecting well cell able synthesise energy certain protein called n protein block mitochondrion stop synthesising atp idea vitamin working way cell synthesising energy form atp using thing called electron carrier something called nadh fadh transported mitochondrion donating electron going another various set process make usable energy infects cell disrupts mitochondrion functioning longer actually become depleted nadh nadh unable effectively donate electron ascorbic acid take place nadh act electron donor synthesise energy almost like ascorbic acid act energy source cell context immune dysfunction usually function ascorbic acid usually used antioxidant damage occurs cell called oxidation cell lose electron function vitamin donate electron called reduction essentially antioxidant used making energy whereas doris loh saying case mitochondrion screwed viral infection vitamin longer becomes antioxidant actually donating electron u make energy well established fact might one reason high dos actually necessary actually providing sustained form energy cell cell infected unable make mean doug interesting elliot might one way vitamin actually beneficial aside role one way messing immune system activating something called cytokine storm innate immune system inflammatory process ramp completely someone susceptible necessarily turn kill per se immune system inability shut immune system vitamin potentially allowing u effectively shut immune system need lot different way vitamin might helping definitely antioxidant multiple different mechanism absolutely fascinating would recommend listener read called mitochondrion vitamin connection really need know vitamin really useful downplay effect antioxidant doug also used pro oxidant well heard pro oxidant capability well something immune system us eliminate virus bacteria thing like elliot exactly think one main mechanism cancer know happening virus familiar effect would make sense case take ascorbic acid low dos generally antioxidant giving ultra high dos actually generates hydrogen peroxide pro oxidant effect particularly cancer cell quite selective cancer cell know would work virus think work infection similar way think lot stuff know erica going back saying cytokine storm stress also effect reaction everyone fear stress feeling sure folk feeling europe also u stress adding cytokine storm inflammation body creating worse environment body ruminating stressing instead trying calm system elliot really unfortunate seems like causing lot harm inherently destructive sheer amount frenzy hysteria going seems relatively disproportionate actual threat compare statistic infectious outbreak seems relatively minor pretty much nothing burger opinion medium make worse boogeyman moment think really scared understandably
